    "detailed_overview": "The Community Garden Grants program supports the maintenance and sustainability of community gardens in five specific counties by providing resources to help neighbors grow food, share knowledge, and strengthen their communities. The program offers two distinct grant opportunities: the Garden Improvement Grant ($1,500) targeting general infrastructure, supply, and material needs, and the Garden Forward Grant ($10,000) for substantial projects aimed at helping the garden thrive. While gardens may apply for both opportunities, only one category of support will be awarded. Applications for the 2026 cycle began in October 2025, with funds distributed in early 2026. Additionally, the Funder offers separate Labor Support Funding (available year-round) to cover costs for specialized contractors (e.g., irrigation installation).",
