The 2026 application cycle began in October 2025, with grants distributed at the beginning of 2026. Applicants can apply for two categories of support: the Garden Improvement Grant ($1,500 intended to address infrastructure, supply, and material needs) or the Garden Forward Grant ($10,000 aimed at supporting a larger project that helps the garden thrive). While a garden is eligible to apply for both, only one category of support will be awarded. Additionally, Food Well Alliance offers separate, year-round Labor Support Funding for specialized contractor costs (e.g., irrigation, shed installation).",
