    "description": "A grant program offering two tiers of funding—$1,500 for infrastructure improvements and $10,000 for larger projects—to support the maintenance and sustainability of community gardens in the Atlanta metropolitan area.",
    "detailed_overview": "The Community Garden Grants program aims to support community gardens in Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett counties by providing resources for upkeep and larger projects. The program consists of two opportunities: the Garden Improvement Grant ($1,500 for infrastructure, supply, and material needs) and the Garden Forward Grant ($10,000 for larger projects intended to help the garden thrive). Gardens can apply for both, but will only be awarded one category of support. The 2026 application cycle began in October 2025, with grants distributed at the beginning of 2026.\n\nSeparately, Food Well Alliance also offers Labor Support Funding year-round, which is intended to cover the labor costs associated with specialized contractors for projects like irrigation installation, shed installation, or water line repairs. This resource is available year-round (rolling deadline) and can be combined with grant funds.",
