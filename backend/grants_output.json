The 2026 cycle, which began applications in October 2025, offers two categories of support for gardens in Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett counties. The Garden Improvement Grant is a $1,500 grant focused on infrastructure, supply, and material needs. The Garden Forward Grant is a larger $10,000 grant aimed at helping gardens move forward with a significant project. A garden is eligible to apply for both opportunities but will only be awarded one. Food Well Alliance also offers separate, year-round Labor Support Funding intended to cover specialized contractor labor costs (e.g., irrigation, shed installation) for garden projects, which can be combined with grant funds.",
