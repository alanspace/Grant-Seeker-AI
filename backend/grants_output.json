    "description": "Provides grants to New York State local governments for projects related to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and planning, supporting both implementation and CSC certification efforts.",
    "detailed_overview": "The Climate Smart Communities (CSC) Grant program was established in 2016 to offer funding to cities, towns, villages, and counties across New York State. Funds are available for two main categories: implementation and certification. Implementation projects support activities like reducing greenhouse gas emissions (outside the power sector), climate change adaptation, and engineering feasibility studies for flood mitigation and Hydrofluorocarbons. Certification projects finance planning and assessment aligned with official Climate Smart Communities certification actions. Specific documentation and requirements are outlined for projects involving land acquisition, whether used as grant funding or as match.",

    "detailed_overview": "The Simons Collaborations program was launched in 2012 to create strong collaborations and foster the cross-pollination of ideas between investigators, aiming to generate unexpected breakthroughs. This model funds groups of outstanding scientists to address timely and important problems, focusing on fields in which significant new developments have created novel opportunities for exploration. The current call from the Life Sciences division seeks vision statements to identify new, emerging breakthrough areas of ecology and evolution, emphasizing research on basic principles of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, especially at their interface, that may be overlooked or considered too risky by other funding organizations.",
